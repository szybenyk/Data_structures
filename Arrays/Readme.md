# **Arrays**
An **array** is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as *2-dimensional arrays*). *Arrays are indexed*, meaning that random access is possible.

#### **Array operations:**
- **Traverse:** Go through the elements and print them.
- **Search:** Search for an element in the array. You can search the element by its value or its index
- **Update:** Update the value of an existing element at a given index

**Inserting** elements to an array and **deleting** elements from an array cannot be done straight away as arrays are fixed in size. If you want to insert an element to an array, first you will have to create a new array with increased size (current size + 1), copy the existing elements and add the new element. The same goes for the deletion with a new array of reduced size.

#### **Applications of arrays:**
- Used as the building blocks to build other data structures such as array lists, heaps, hash tables, vectors and matrices.
- Used for different sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, quick sort, bubble sort and merge sort.
